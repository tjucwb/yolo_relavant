# yolo_relavant
inlcudes functions regarding yolov3, trying to update
yolo-kmeans is used for create k anchors for yolov3,
the annotation follows CityPersons: A Diverse Dataset for Pedestrian Detection
and to used this code, just modify some path for saving and the name in the annotation file(like aim label in this code to other name)


the idea is inspired by https://github.com/dleam/YOLO-v3-kmeans
